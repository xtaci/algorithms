/*

   1 Create a map to store frequency of each number in the array. (Single traversal is required)
   2 In the next traversal, for every element check if it can be combined with any other element (other than itself!) to give the desired sum. Increment the counter accordingly.
   3 After completion of second traversal, weâ€™d have twice the required value stored in counter because every pair is counted two times. Hence divide count by 2 and return.
